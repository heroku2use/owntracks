Demo app to display my current run on a map, powered by owntracks, dropwizard, 
and leaflet.js

Currently: 
-displays an index page with a leaflet.js map centered roughly on Portland, OR
-has javascript to load latest location and re-center map onto latest location received from broker
-responds to requests to /api/location with a default location of 45.523, -122.676 or "beep boop" if an error occurs
-responds to requests to /api/rawupates with raw owntracks mqtt messages since application startup
  -responds to requests to /api/rawupdates/since/{tst} with owntracks messages from broker since epoch timestamp (only messages after application startup)
  -responds to requests to /api/rawupdates/latest with latest owntracks message from broker
  -loops to check updated location every 30 seconds and adds new points to map

TODO:
-convert owntracks location messages to GeoJSON
