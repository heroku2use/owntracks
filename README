Demo app to display my current run on a map, powered by owntracks, dropwizard, 
and leaflet.js

Currently: 
-displays an index page with leaflet.js loaded but not initialized
-responds to requests to /api/location with "beep boop"

TODO:
-connect to mqtt broker and subscribe to a topic with owntracks messages from phone
-convert owntracks location messages to GeoJSON
-javascript on index page to request current location from /api/location and add to map
-healthcheck to confirm that the mqtt broker is online
